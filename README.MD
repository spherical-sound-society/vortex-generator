VORTEX GENERATOR

As 31 of May of 2020 Vortex Generator goes open source. The hardware remains closed source, so please dont fabricate it. You can still get PCBs kits and build modules in my tindie at:

The Vortex Generator is at its core a function generator, not that different from a Maths, DUGS or Rampage. It produces peaks and valleys at voltage controllable timing amounts. The twist here is that it has a shift register performing bit-wise operations between its channels, in a Benjolin or Rungler style. The result is a extremely musical modulator that can output sequences too. The envelopes has been crafted with percussion in mind, so its easy to achieve all kind of percussive and rhythmic outputs, variations and mayhem.

Channel A and B has a trigger output that goes high at every end of cycle. And thereÂ´s a 4th clock trigger out that goes high every 4th tick of channel A (the clock). It has triggers to start both channels and every channel can work in single cycle mode and in looping mode.
